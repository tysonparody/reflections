What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

The git initialization is what connects your repository to the github and to the functionality of using git as version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the space where the files reside as a group so they can all be committed at the same time. Kind of a place for them to be orgainzed. The repository is the collection of all your work on a project. The working directory is the structure for the files.
