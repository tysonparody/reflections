When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

If you were working on another computer or if others were working on a project with you.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your rmeote repostitory?

you may not want all the changes updated to your local repo. Too many pulls would be excessive.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?

Fork -- clones only from github then adds it to local directory

Clone -- copies files on github or on local

Branch -- an alternate line of development for a project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Ensures that you can trace back to a version you remember if many changes are made.
