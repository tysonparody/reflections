When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

If you were working on another computer or if others were working on a project with you.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your rmeote repostitory?

you may not want all the changes updated to your local repo. Too many pulls would be excessive.
